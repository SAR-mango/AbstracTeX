# AbstracTeX
## Overview
The purpose of this program is to abstract out the LaTeX implementations of the following:
- Drawings (circuits, block diagrams, simple shapes)
- Graphs (2D graphs of functions and direction fields)
- Tables (all sorts of them â€“ truth tables, data tables, Karnaugh Maps...)
- Title, section, and subsection formatting
- Figures and captions
- Headers and footers
